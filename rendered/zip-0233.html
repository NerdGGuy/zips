<h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “MAY”, “RECOMMENDED”,
“OPTIONAL”, and “REQUIRED” in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119. [1]</p>
<p>The term “network upgrade” in this document is to be interpreted as
described in ZIP 200. [2]</p>
<p>“Block Subsidy” - the algorithmic issuance of ZEC on block creation.
Part of the consensus rules. Split between the miner and the Dev Fund.
Also known as Block Reward.</p>
<p>“Issuance” - The method by which ZEC becomes available for
circulation on the network.</p>
<p>“We” - the ZIP Owners and Authors, listed in the above front
matter.</p>
<p>“<code>MAX_MONEY</code>” is the total ZEC supply cap, defined as
21,000,000 ZEC. This is slightly larger than the supply cap for the
current issuance mechanism, but is the value used in existing critical
consensus checks.</p>
<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>We propose the introduction of a mechanism to voluntarily burn funds,
removing those funds entirely from circulation on the network. This
mechanism, in combination with ZIPs 234 and 235, comprises a long-term
strategy for the sustainability of the network. We will refer to the
combined effects of these three ZIPs as the “Network Sustainability
Mechanism”.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>This mechanism seeks to address concerns about the sustainability of
the network design shared by Bitcoin-like systems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Long Term Consensus Sustainability:</strong> By enabling the
burning of funds, the network gains the ability to create “headroom”
between the chain value and <code>MAX_MONEY</code>. This lays necessary
groundwork for extending the miner reward system, which currently has a
clear final end date.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits to ZEC Holders:</strong> Burning funds reduces the
supply of ZEC, benefiting network users in proportion to their holdings
without requiring them to opt into any scheme, introducing extra risk,
active oversight, or accounting complexity.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>
<p>The modifications required are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The addition of a transaction field representing an amount to burn
for a given transaction.</li>
<li>The inclusion of the burn amount in the calculated total output
value for a given transaction.</li>
<li>Consensus rules to ensure the burned amount is no longer available
for circulation on the network.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="transaction-format">Transaction Format</h2>
<p>The following field is added to the v6 transaction format [3]:</p>
<table style="width:98%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 8%" />
<col style="width: 17%" />
<col style="width: 13%" />
<col style="width: 57%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Bytes</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Data Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>8</td>
<td><code>burnAmount</code></td>
<td><code>uint64</code></td>
<td>The amount of input value to be burned, in zatoshis.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Older transaction versions can continue to be
supported after a network upgrade, but burning is not possible for these
transactions. For example, NU5 supports both v4 and v5 transaction
formats, for both coinbase and non-coinbase transactions.</p>
<h2 id="consensus-rules">Consensus Rules</h2>
<p>The burned value must now be considered when calculating the total
output value of a transaction. It should be treated similarly to a
transparent output, except that there is no way for this value to be
used as an input in a future transaction.</p>
<h2 id="digests">Digests</h2>
<p>The transaction digest algorithm defined in ZIP 244 [4] is to be
modified for v6 transactions as follows:</p>
<p>Section T.1: header_digest [5] is specified in draft-txv6-sighash [6]
to read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values:</p>
<pre><code>T.1a: version             (4-byte little-endian version identifier including ``fOverwintered`` flag)
T.1b: version_group_id    (4-byte little-endian version group identifier)
T.1c: consensus_branch_id (4-byte little-endian consensus branch id)
T.1d: lock_time           (4-byte little-endian ``nLockTime`` value)
T.1e: expiry_height       (4-byte little-endian block height)
T.1f: burn_amount         (8-byte little-endian burn amount value)</code></pre>
<p>The personalization field of this hash is set to:</p>
<pre><code>ZTxIdHeadersHash</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<p>All technical decisions in this ZIP are balanced between the
necessary robustness of the NSM mechanics, and simplicity of
implementation.</p>
<h2 id="new-transaction-field-for-burn-amount">New transaction field for
burn amount</h2>
<p>An explicit value distinguishes the burned ZEC from the transaction
fee. Explicitness also ensures any arithmetic flaws in any
implementations are more likely to be observed and caught
immediately.</p>
<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>
<p>This ZIP is proposed to activate with Network Upgrade 7.</p>
