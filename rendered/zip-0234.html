<p>“ZEC/TAZ” refers to the native currency of Zcash on a given network,
i.e. ZEC on Mainnet and TAZ on Testnet.</p>
<p>The terms “Block Subsidy”, “Issuance”, and “Burning” are to be

by <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY} -
\mathsf{IssuedSupply}(\mathsf{height})\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>This ZIP proposes a change to how nodes calculate the block
subsidy.</p>
<p>Instead of following a step function around the 4-year halving
intervals inherited from Bitcoin, we propose a smooth logarithmic curve,
defined as a fixed portion of the current value of the Money Reserve at
a given block height.</p>
<p>The new issuance scheme would approximate the current issuance over
4-year intervals, assuming no ZEC/TAZ is burned during that time, and
retains the overall supply cap of <code>MAX_MONEY</code>.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>Key Objectives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We want to introduce an automated mechanism that allows users of the
network to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the
network.</li>
<li>We want to enable ZEC that has been burned to be recreated in the
future to benefit network sustainability.</li>
<li>We want to retain the existing ZEC supply cap of 21 million.</li>
<li>We want the issuance rate to remain similar to the historical rate
for Zcash (and before that, Bitcoin).</li>
<li>We want issuance to be easy for all network users to understand and
predict.</li>
<li>We want the new issuance to activate at a block with as minimal a
delta from the current issuance as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>The current Zcash economic model, inherited from Bitcoin, includes a
halving mechanism that dictates the issuance of new coins. While this
has been foundational, halvings can lead to abrupt changes in the rate
of new coins being introduced to the market. Such sudden shifts can
potentially disrupt the network’s economic model, potentially impacting
its security and stability. Furthermore, the halvings schedule is fixed
and does not provide any way to “recycle” funds into future
issuance.</p>
<p>This new NSM-based issuance scheme solves these problems by ensuring
a more consistent and predictable rate of coin issuance, while
preserving the core aspects of Zcash’s issuance policy and the
21-million-coin cap. At the same time, it introduces the first mechanism
to recreate and distribute ZEC that has been removed from circulation,
as well as unclaimed transaction fees, across future block
subsidies.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<p>Smoothing the issuance curve is possible using an exponential decay
formula that satisfies the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The issuance can be summarized into a reasonably simple
explanation.</li>
<li>Block subsidies approximate a continuous function.</li>
<li>If the Money Reserve is greater than 0, then the block subsidy must
be non-zero, preventing any final “unmined” zatoshis.</li>
<li>For any 4-year period, all paid out block subsidies are
approximately equal to half of the Money Reserve at the beginning of
that 4-year period, if no ZEC is burned during those 4 years.</li>
<li>Decrease the short-term impact of the deployment of this ZIP on
block subsidy recipients, and minimize the potential reputation risk to
Zcash of changing the block subsidy amount.</li>
<li>The immediate change in issuance when this mechanism activates
should be minimal.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>
<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION} = 4126
/ 10\_000\_000\_000 = 0.0000004126\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{DEPLOYMENT\_BLOCK\_HEIGHT} =
\mathsf{TBD}\)</span></p>
<p>The block height will be chosen by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is after NU7 activation height.</li>
<li>It is calculated to be the lowest height after the second halving at
which the NSM issuance would be less than the current BTC-style issuance
<em>neglecting</em> any burnt ZEC (i.e. assuming the amount of ZEC burnt
is exactly 0).</li>
</ul>
<p>This selection is intended to achieve Key Objective 6 while still
being at a constant, predictable height. An alternative would be to have
a dynamic “latch”-style activation, which would calculate the activation
height by testing the “less than” conditional with every block after the
second halving. We prefer the pre-defined constant height parameter, to
give everyone more <em>time</em> certainty at the cost of <em>issuance
level</em> certainty.</p>
<p>The difference in up-front calculation versus dynamic calculation is
in whether or not burns are accounted for (since future burns cannot be
calculated up-front). This means with the pre-defined constant parameter
approach, issuance will jump <em>up</em> some amount at activation. This
amount should be equivalent to all ZEC burnt prior to that height times
<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION}\)</span>.
For example, if a total of 100,000 ZEC were burnt prior to the
pre-defined constant activation height, then at activation the issuance
would be larger than BTC-style issuance by <span
class="math inline">\(100\_000\textsf{ ZEC} \cdot
\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION}\)</span>, which we calculate equals
<span class="math inline">\(0.04126\)</span> ZEC. This example is chosen
to demonstrate that a very large burn amount (much larger than expected)
would elevate issuance by a relatively small amount. For this reason, we
believe a pre-defined constant is a better approach to achieving Key
Objective 6 than a “dynamic latch” logic because it is so much simpler
to implement and reason about.</p>
<p><span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{MoneyReserveAfter}(\mathsf{height})
=\)</span> The value of the Money Reserve after the specified block
height.</p>
<h2 id="issuance-calculation">Issuance Calculation</h2>
<p>At the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{DEPLOYMENT\_BLOCK\_HEIGHT}\)</span>, nodes
should switch from the current issuance calculation, to the
following:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BlockSubsidy}(\mathsf{height}) =
\mathsf{ceiling}(\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION} \cdot
\mathsf{MoneyReserveAfter}(\mathsf{height} - 1))\)</span></p>
<h2 id="applicability">Applicability</h2>
<p>All of these changes apply identically to Mainnet and Testnet.</p>
<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<ul>
<li>Using an exponential decay function satisfies <strong>Requirements
1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> above.</li>
<li>We round up to the next zatoshi to satisfy <strong>Requirement
3</strong> above.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="block_subsidy_fraction">BLOCK_SUBSIDY_FRACTION</h2>
<p>Let <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{IntendedMoneyReserveFractionRemainingAfterFourYears}
= 0.5\)</span>.</p>
<p>The value <span class="math inline">\(4126 /
10\_000\_000\_000\)</span> satisfies the approximation within <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 0.002\%\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((1 -
\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION})^\mathsf{PostBlossomHalvingInterval}
\approx
\mathsf{IntendedMoneyReserveFractionRemainingAfterFourYears}\)</span></p>
<p>This implies that after a period of 4 years around half of Money
Reserve will have been issued as block subsidies, thus satisfying
<strong>Requirement 4</strong>.</p>
<p>The largest possible value in the Money Reserve is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY}\)</span>, in the theoretically
possible case that all issued funds are burned. If this happened, the
largest interim sum in the block subsidy calculation would be <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY} \cdot 4126 /
10\_000\_000\_000\)</span>.</p>
<p>This uses 62.91 bits, which is just under the 63-bit limit for signed
two’s complement 64-bit integer amount types.</p>
<p>The numerator could be brought closer to the limit by using a larger
denominator, but the difference in the amount issued would be very
small. So we chose a power-of-10 denominator for simplicity.</p>
<p>TODO for ZIP owners: How many ZEC per day?</p>

<h1 id="appendix-simulation">Appendix: Simulation</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/eigerco/zsf-simulator">NSM
Simulator</a> allows us to simulate the effects of this ZIP on the Money
Reserve and the block subsidy, as well as generate plots like the ones
above. Its output:</p>
<pre><code>Last block is 47917869 in ~113.88 years</code></pre>
<p>indicates that, assuming that no ZEC is ever burned, the Money
Reserve will be depleted after 113.88 years, and the block subsidy will
be 0 ZEC after that point.</p>
<p>This fragment of the output:</p>
<pre><code>Halving  1 at block  1680000:
  NSM subsidies:    262523884819889 (~ 2625238.848 ZEC,        1.563 ZEC per block)
  legacy subsidies: 262500000000000 (~ 2625000.000 ZEC,        1.562 ZEC per block)
  difference:           23884819889 (~         238 ZEC),         NSM/legacy: 1.0001</code></pre>
<p>shows that the difference between the smoothed out and the current
issuance schemes is 238 ZEC after 1680000 blocks (around 4 years).</p>
