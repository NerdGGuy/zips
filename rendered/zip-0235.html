<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>This ZIP proposes to burn 60% of transaction fees, while the
remaining 40% is directed as before, providing a deflationary effect,
and building the groundwork for long-term support of the Zcash network
via the new block subsidy rules proposed by ZIP 234 <a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>ZIP 233 (“Network Sustainability Mechanism: Burning” <a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>)
describes a method by which ZEC can be burned to support network
sustainability.</p>
<p>By introducing a requirement that a certain proportion of transaction
fees be burned, we ensure that ZEC will be removed from circulating
supply to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the network as
described below:</p>
<h2 id="benefits-to-the-network">Benefits to the Network</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Network Sustainability</strong>: This mechanism involves
temporarily reducing the supply of ZEC, similar to asset burning in
Ethereum’s EIP-1559 <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, but with long-term sustainability
benefits, as the burned funds effectively boost future mining rewards,
making it an attractive option for current and future Zcash users.</li>
<li><strong>Incentivizing Transaction Inclusion</strong>: By maintaining
a 40% share of transaction fees for miners, we continue incentivizing
miners to prioritize including transactions in their blocks. This helps
ensure the continued efficient processing of transactions and supports a
robust and responsive network.</li>
<li><strong>Aligning Interests:</strong> Burning transaction fees aligns
the interests of miners with the long-term health of the network,
incentivizing them to prioritize security and efficiency. As miners
focus on maintaining a robust network, overall adoption and usage can
increase, leading to higher transaction volumes in the long run. This
structure discourages short-term profit-seeking behaviors, as miners
benefit more from a stable and thriving ecosystem than from engaging in
malicious activities that could undermine the network’s reputation and
security.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proofing the Network</strong>: Burning a portion of
transaction fees is a forward-looking approach that prepares the Zcash
network for future challenges and opportunities. It establishes a
financial buffer that can be instrumental in addressing unforeseen
issues and seizing strategic advantages as the Zcash ecosystem
evolves.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>For each block, at least 60% (rounded down) of the total fees are to
be burned.</li>
<li>No restrictions are placed on the destination of the remaining
proportion of fees.</li>
<li>Any fractions are rounded in favor of the miner.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>
<h2 id="consensus-rule-changes">Consensus Rule Changes</h2>
<p>For a given block, the coinbase transaction MUST have a <span
class="math inline">burn_amount</span>, as defined in <a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>,
that is greater than or equal to <span
class="math inline">floor(transactionFees ⋅ 6/10) </span>.</p>
<p>The version of a coinbase transaction MUST be v6 or later <a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="applicability">Applicability</h2>
<p>All of these changes apply identically to Mainnet and Testnet.</p>
<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<p>We believe the proposed changes to be relatively low-impact in terms
of implementation and protocol changes. Additionally, transaction fees
are currently small enough that the reduction in miner fees is unlikely
to be a concern.</p>
<h2
id="rationale-for-requiring-the-coinbase-transaction-to-be-v6-or-later">Rationale
for requiring the coinbase transaction to be v6 or later</h2>
<p>There is no explicit mechanism in prior transaction versions to burn
the required funds. Since <span
class="math inline">burn_amount = 0</span> for transaction versions
prior to v6, absent the rule about the coinbase transaction version it
would be technically possible to satisfy the constraint on <span
class="math inline">burn_amount</span> with earlier versions than v6,
but only when <span class="math inline">transactionFees = 0</span>. That
would introduce a corner case in the transaction consensus rules that is
not useful, since it is expected that the <span
class="math inline">transactionFees</span> will normally be
non-zero.</p>
<h2 id="estimated-impact-on-miners">Estimated impact on miners</h2>
<p>Over 100,000 blocks starting at block 2235515, there were 316130
transactions. 60608 of them are categorized as ‘sandblasting’
transactions. The remaining transactions have an average of 5.46 logical
actions (see ZIP 317 <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>).</p>
<p>The total fees paid to miners from those transactions, assuming the
ZIP 317 regime, would be 87.86 ZEC. 100,000 blocks is approximately 3
months of blocks. Extrapolating to a year, we would expect 351.44 ZEC in
fees paid to miners over a year.</p>
<p>If 60% of these fees burned, that would be 210.864 ZEC per year. <a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="considerations-for-the-future">Considerations for the
Future</h2>
<p>If transaction fees were to increase, further modifications can
easily be proposed to alter the 60%/40% split. Finding the optimal fee
split may require an iterative approach involving adjustments based on
real-world data and network dynamics.</p>
<p>Looking further into the future, there may come a time when the
transaction fees become greater than the block subsidy issuance. At that
time we may need to reconsider the 60/40 split. However, this will
likely not be the case for the next 8-10 years due to forecasts based on
issuance models and network traffic.</p>
<p>Further ZIPs may be proposed to burn ZEC in various ways to support
network sustainability, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZSA fees</li>
<li>Fees and donations specific to decentralized applications</li>
<li>“Storage fees” for any future data availability</li>
<li>Cross-chain bridge usage / Cross-chain messaging</li>
<li>Note sorting micro-transactional fees</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>
<p>The implementation of this ZIP MUST be deployed at the same time or
after ZIP 233 (“NSM: Burning” <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>), and ZIP 234 (“NSM:
Issuance Smoothing” <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>).</p>
