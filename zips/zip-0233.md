# Terminology

The key word "MUST" in this document is to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [^BCP14] when, and only when, it appears in all capitals.

The term "network upgrade" in this document is to be interpreted as described
in ZIP 200. [^zip-0200]

The character § is used when referring to sections of the Zcash Protocol
Specification. [^protocol]

The terms "Mainnet" and "Testnet" are to be interpreted as described in
§ 3.12 ‘Mainnet and Testnet’. [^protocol-networks]

"ZEC/TAZ" refers to the native currency of Zcash on a given network, i.e.
ZEC on Mainnet and TAZ on Testnet.

"Block Subsidy" - The algorithmic issuance of ZEC/TAZ on block creation, as
defined by consensus. This is split between the miner and Funding Streams.

"Issuance" - The method by which ZEC/TAZ becomes available for circulation
on the network. [TODO: there is a potential terminology conflict between
this and issuance as defined in ZIP 227.]

"Burning" - The method by which ZEC/TAZ becomes unavailable for circulation
on the network.

$\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY}$, as defined in § 5.3 ‘Constants’ [^protocol-constants],
is the total ZEC/TAZ supply cap measured in zatoshi, corresponding to
21,000,000 ZEC. This is slightly larger than the supply cap for the current
issuance mechanism, but is the value used in existing critical consensus
checks.


# Abstract

This ZIP proposes the introduction of a mechanism to voluntarily burn funds,
removing those funds entirely from circulation on the network. This mechanism,
in combination with ZIP 234 [^zip-0234] and ZIP 235 [^zip-0235], comprises a
long-term strategy for the sustainability of the network. We will refer to the
combined effects of these three ZIPs as the “Network Sustainability Mechanism”.


# Motivation

This mechanism seeks to address concerns about the sustainability of the network
design shared by Bitcoin-like systems:

1. **Long Term Consensus Sustainability:** By enabling the burning of funds, the
   network gains the ability to create "headroom" between the chain value and
   $\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY}$. This lays necessary groundwork for extending the
   block subsidy system, which currently has a clear final end date.
2. **Benefits to ZEC Holders:** Burning funds reduces the supply of ZEC,
   benefiting network users in proportion to their holdings without requiring
   them to opt into any scheme, introducing extra risk, active oversight, or
   accounting complexity.


# Specification

The modifications required are:

1. The addition of a transaction field representing an amount to burn for a
   given transaction.
2. The inclusion of the burn amount in the calculated total output value for a
   given transaction.
3. Consensus rules to ensure the burned amount is no longer available for
   circulation on the network.

## Transaction Format

The following field is added to the v6 transaction format [3]:

+-------+----------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Bytes | Name           | Data Type  | Description                                          |
+=======+================+============+======================================================+
|   8   | ``burnAmount`` | ``uint64`` | The amount of input value to be burned, in zatoshis. |
+-------+----------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+

**Note:** Older transaction versions can continue to be supported after a
network upgrade, but burning is not possible for these transactions. For
example, NU5 supports both v4 and v5 transaction formats, for both coinbase and
non-coinbase transactions.

## Consensus Rules

The burned value must now be considered when calculating the total output value
of a transaction. It should be treated similarly to a transparent output,
except that there is no way for this value to be used as an input in a future
transaction.

## Digests

The transaction digest algorithm defined in ZIP 244 [4] is to be modified for v6
transactions as follows:

Section T.1: header_digest [5] is specified in draft-txv6-sighash  [6] to read:

> A BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values:
>
> ```
> T.1a: version             (4-byte little-endian version identifier including ``fOverwintered`` flag)
> T.1b: version_group_id    (4-byte little-endian version group identifier)
> T.1c: consensus_branch_id (4-byte little-endian consensus branch id)
> T.1d: lock_time           (4-byte little-endian ``nLockTime`` value)
> T.1e: expiry_height       (4-byte little-endian block height)
> T.1f: burn_amount         (8-byte little-endian burn amount value)
> ```
>
> The personalization field of this hash is set to:
>
> ```
> ZTxIdHeadersHash
> ```

# Rationale

All technical decisions in this ZIP are balanced between the necessary
robustness of the NSM mechanics, and simplicity of implementation.

## New transaction field for burn amount

An explicit value distinguishes the burned ZEC from the transaction fee.
Explicitness also ensures any arithmetic flaws in any implementations are more
likely to be observed and caught immediately.


# Deployment

This ZIP is proposed to activate with Network Upgrade 7. [^zip-0254]
